# SymmetricPSF
Code for the calculation of PSF in two photon microscopy using Matlab
This code requires information about the legths of media between the aperture of the microscope and the focal point.
This code only works for media with parallel interfaces aligned with the propagation direction of the imaging beam.
This code is based on Wolf's integral method and therefore is better suited for systems with high aperture.
